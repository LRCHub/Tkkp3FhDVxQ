La-ta-ta-ta-ta-la
It's an illusion, don't wake up

Wonder why I can't satisfy
Overnight, feeling like you're dying
I hold the world in my hands, everything is in my hands
(I got it, I got it, only in my bones)
Oh, I'm crying to this darkest sky
There's no light in this lonely night
Even if I never have everything that I want
Can't stop getting all

I cannot see a future for me
From everything that I have built in this life
Even if it's bound to come crumbling down
I hope to someday come alive
Just give me more power

Let's roll the dice and dance the night away
Let еvery nightmare in your heart drivе you crazy
Let's dance in our sin, let the guilty in
Even if we succumb to emptiness
Pa-pa-la-li-la-li

La-ta-ta-ta-ta-la, it's all a dream, no don't wake up
La-ta-ta-ta-ta-la, get away, hurry, hurry!
La-ta-ta-ta-ta-la, this night is dark and endless
La-ta-ta-ta-ta-la, broken, oh no! I'm falling
Oh no! I am falling... down
